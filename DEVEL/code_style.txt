dungeon DevTeam Coding Style
============================

Dungeon written in C, include C-style coding. Sources in C use ASCII encoding, so as for console symbols,
In the future game will transform to Unicode encoding  with support backward compatibility ASCII codes.
This document are focused on primarily with the style used for C sources. Script for check
style will be attach in repositories, when script will have been released.


Spacing
-------------------------------------------
The basic indentation is 4 spaces wide. No tabs.

Line should be at most 80 characters wide. If a line is longer than the limit, text should be divided.
It portion should be aligned by 4 spaces in next string.(in case DEFINEs - 8 spaces and symbol '\' at end);

    int i_var
        = MatrixVibreCultiveNumOfArray;

    #define macrocall(reg, arg)     \
            reg = arg; 

Single blank line should be used wherever to improve readability and logical to divide independent parts.


Definition and declaration functions
-------------------------------------------

There are two general styles. One with no comments, where arguments are added one after another on one line.
Then comment must be before definition of function. The return type places in one line.

    /*
    *  comments style
    */
    void fcall_init(int df, char sc) {
        // body
    }

The open bracket also places in one line with definition.

The second style has focuse to divide logic portions. For a function definition, the return type,
declaration, and opening brace should each appear on a line of their own. The comment write in 
one line.

    void
    ThreeDivFiveFun(
        int one,            // one arg
        int two,            // two arg
        int three)          // three arg
    {
        /* body */
    }


Conditional and cycles
